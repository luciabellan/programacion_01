Exercise 1: 
Write a program that allows you to read N integers from the keyboard and obtain their sum. The value N is a constant.

Exercise 2: 
Write a program that asks for two integers on the screen that we will call the lower limit and upper limit, between 0 and 30000, and a third integer that we will call the number to investigate, which must be between the lower limit and the upper limit.
Subsequently, the program should present on the screen:
- All the multiples of the number to investigate included between both limits.
-How many are the previous numbers presented.
- The value of your sum.

Exercise 3: 
Write a program that presents the multiplication table of the first num integers, with their first 20 products.

Exercise 4: 
calculate the sum of the series
1/2 2/2 ...n/(n+1)
until the term n that is entered by keyboard.
The value of n must be between (0<n<=60000).

It must be validated that the value of n entered is within the indicated range, and if not, ask the user for the value again until he enters it correctly.
Once the program provides the results on the screen, it must ask the user if they want to make a new data entry so that the program provides new results, or if they want to exit it. The message to display on the screen will be:
Exit program(Y/N):

In case the user types the letter Y uppercase or lowercase, the program should terminate. Every time the user types the uppercase or lowercase letter N, the program will have to request new input data again and provide the corresponding results. In the event that a different character is typed, the program must ask the user the question again.

Exercise 5:
