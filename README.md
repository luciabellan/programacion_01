Ejercicio2: 
Write a program that asks for two integers on the screen that we will call the lower limit and upper limit, between 0 and 30000, and a third integer that we will call the number to investigate, which must be between the lower limit and the upper limit.
Subsequently, the program should present on the screen:
- All the multiples of the number to investigate included between both limits.
-How many are the previous numbers presented.
- The value of your sum.
